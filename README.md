## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaktestowac/bughuntfest-playwright-patterns.git
   cd bughuntfest-playwright-patterns
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Run specific test file:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/modularity/flashposts.spec.ts
```

Run tests with UI mode:

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

Generate test report:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Tests fail on first run**

   - Ensure ðŸ¦Ž GAD application is running
   - Check if correct Node.js version is installed

2. **Browser launch fails**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```
